# TDD ToDo workflow

Write the tests that will use your app. Write your logic first with TDD. Do the UI later.

Currently, there is a failing test in Todo.test.ts for you to start by writing production code.

*Hint: We need a class in `Todo.ts` made and imported into `Todo.test.ts`.*

## Next up

Clone/Fork and finish the logic writing your tests first.
